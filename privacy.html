            <p><strong>Our Privacy Commitment:</strong> Screen League is designed with your privacy as a top priority. We do not collect, store, or share your personal information. Your focus sessions, app blocking preferences, and league data remain private and under your control.</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Screen League ("we," "our," or "the app") is a focus timer application that helps you stay productive by blocking distracting apps during focus sessions. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.
            </p>

                <strong>Key Principle:</strong> We believe your productivity data is yours alone. We've designed Screen League to keep your information private and secure on your device.

            <h2>3. Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
            <p>The following information is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and never leaves it:</p>
            
            <h3>Focus Session Data:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Timer durations and completion times</li>
                <li>Points earned from completed focus sessions</li>

                <li>Display and notification preferences</li>

            <h2>4. League Features and iCloud Sync</h2>
            <p>
                Screen League offers optional multiplayer league features where you can compete with friends. When you create or join a league, the following limited information is synced via your personal iCloud account:
            </p>

            <h3>Data Synced via iCloud:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>League Information:</strong> League name, settings, and participant list</li>
                <li><strong>Weekly Scores:</strong> Points earned and focus minutes completed (aggregated totals only)</li>
                <li><strong>User Display Name:</strong> The nickname you choose to display in leagues</li>
                <li><strong>User ID:</strong> A randomly generated identifier (not linked to your Apple ID)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How iCloud Sync Works:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is synced through <strong>your personal iCloud account</strong> using Apple's CloudKit service</li>
                <li>We do not operate servers that store your data</li>
                <li>Only members of your private league can see your scores and display name</li>
                <li>League data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple</li>
                <li>You can delete league data at any time by leaving or deleting leagues</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You don't need to create an account with us. League features work entirely through your existing iCloud account, and you control who can see your information by choosing who to invite to your leagues.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>5. How We Use Apple's Screen Time API</h2>
            <p>
                Screen League uses Apple's Screen Time API (FamilyControls and ManagedSettings frameworks) to temporarily block apps during your focus sessions. This API is essential for providing the core functionality of the app.
            </p>

            <h3>Screen Time API Usage:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To block distracting apps during active focus timers while allowing essential apps</li>
                <li><strong>How It Works:</strong> During focus sessions, all apps are blocked except essential system apps (Phone, Messages, Maps, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Whitelist Approach:</strong> We determine which essential apps remain accessible to ensure safety and usability</li>
                <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Requires your explicit permission in iOS Settings</li>
                <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> All app blocking happens locally on your device</li>
                <li><strong>No User Selection:</strong> You don't choose which apps to block—we apply a standard set of restrictions</li>
                <li><strong>Individual Use:</strong> Configured for personal productivity (not parental controls)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Maximum Privacy Design:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't select apps, so we never see your app preferences or choices</li>
                <li>We cannot determine which apps you have installed on your device</li>
                <li>All apps are automatically blocked during timers except essential system apps</li>
                <li>No app usage statistics are collected or analyzed</li>
                <li>The whitelist is determined by us to include only critical apps (Phone, Messages, emergency services, etc.)</li>
                <li>You can revoke Screen Time permission at any time in iOS Settings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future Premium Features:</h3>
            <p>
                We may offer the ability to customize which apps are allowed during focus sessions as a premium feature. 
                If implemented, your customization preferences would be stored locally on your device and never transmitted to our servers.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Apple's Privacy Protection:</strong> The Screen Time API is designed by Apple with privacy in mind. App tokens (identifiers for allowed/blocked apps) are encrypted and cannot be reverse-engineered to determine which specific apps you're using.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Screen League does not integrate with any third-party services, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No advertising networks or ad tracking</li>
                <li>No analytics or crash reporting services</li>
                <li>No social media integrations</li>
                <li>No payment processors (app is free)</li>
                <li>No cloud storage services (except Apple iCloud for league features)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Apple Services Only:</strong> The only external service we use is Apple's CloudKit (part of iCloud), which is covered in Section 4 above.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement security measures to protect your information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On-Device Storage:</strong> Your personal data stays on your device, protected by iOS security features</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud Encryption:</strong> League data synced via CloudKit is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
                <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We don't operate servers that could be breached or hacked</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Data:</strong> We only sync the minimum information needed for league features</li>
                <li><strong>Apple's Security:</strong> All data storage and sync relies on Apple's industry-leading security practices</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Screen League is designed for personal productivity use and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. The app uses the "individual" Screen Time mode (not parental controls or child monitoring).
            </p>
            <p>
                Parents should be aware that while the app can help teens develop better focus habits, it is not a parental control tool and does not provide monitoring capabilities.
